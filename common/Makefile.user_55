# This is a common Makefile for all of the examples.  "UWTOOL",

# Variables starting with "DEV_" are reserved for communicating
# build parameters into the core makefiles (in .../samples/common).
#
# Those starting with "VMW_" are reserved for VMware use, and should

# explicitly documented otherwise.
#
# Note that many variables do not currently follow the above
# patterns.  This is to minimize changes required in existing
# partner code.

################
# First, define the end environment(s) with the following two
# variables.  As shown here, one is defined.  If more than one is
# necessary, these values will need to be set on a per-target basis,
# or in a loop that recursively invokes make with each set of values
# provided on the command line.
#
# This parameter must be set.

# Legal values for DEV_TARGET_CONTEXT are "vmkernel" or "uw".
DEV_TARGET_CONTEXT = uw

################
# This controls which class of compiler options to use.  Allowed
# values are "beta" (for debugging) and "release".  The default is
# the type of the ESX build that produced this devkit.

# substitutions pattern may need to put the intermediate files in a
# more convenient location.

################
# If creating a standalone userworld application, as opposed to a

# empty.  If the latter, any content may be used.

################
# Define here any additional libraries required by uncommenting the
# appropriate variable(s) and modifying as needed.  If the library is
# not included in the devkit distribution, include a -L /some/path
# parameter before the -lname parameter so that the linker can find
# it.  The *PRE* variables are included as the first library
# directives.  The *POST* variables are included as the last library
# directives.

################
# If the vdsPublic library needs to be included in the compilation,
# uncomment the following assignment.  Currently, that library only
# comes as part of the "kmdk-devtools-vds" devkit, so it and any
# other devkit components it depends on will need to be installed
# on the same development host as this devkit.  The value must be
# empty for not needing vdsPublic, and non-empty for needing it.
# The actual content is not examined.

################

# HExDK's build system, and it doesn't do that inclusion by default.
